# Unit 2: MySQL

Repository for work on the MySQL `recipes` project from the video curriculum.

## Week 7: Introduction to MySQL

**Note:** When updating any on-going project, like the projects in MySQL (e.g. `mysql-java`), it is totally acceptable to use the same GitHub repo, and push the project as you finish a Coding Assignment (e.g. create one repo **— named whatever you want to name it —** to use for each week that you are updating the same project).

**Additional Tip:**

Make sure that you include the **correct URL** for the GitHub repo associated with each assignment that you submit to the LMS. You will submit each week with a new Video.
